# 24 minute Pomodoro

## Underlying principles
### There are five basic steps to implementing the technique:
### Decide on the task to be done
### Set the pomodoro timer to n minutes (traditionally 25)[1]
### Work on the task until the timer rings; record with an x
### Take a short break (3–5 minutes)
### After four pomodori, take a longer break (15–30 minutes)
